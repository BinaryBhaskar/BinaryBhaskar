### About me

I build Android applications that are meant to be used, not just showcased.  
I care about clean architecture, thoughtful UX, and small details that make software feel calm and reliable.

I’m currently pursuing a **dual degree** in **Data Science at IIT Madras** and **Information Technology**, and I spend most of my time designing, building, and refining mobile products that solve real problems.

Some of my work is already in production, including a **Smart India Hackathon–winning solution** and Android apps used by **100+ local businesses**.
